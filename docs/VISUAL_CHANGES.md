### Color Accessibility
- Orange (#FF8C00) provides high contrast on white backgrounds
- White text maintains readability on orange backgrounds
- Dark text (#1C1B1F) ensures optimal readability on light surfaces

### Logo Integration Features

The application now presents a cohesive, professional Connectly brand experience with the signature orange and white color scheme consistently applied across all user interfaces.

**Note**: Once actual Connectly logo PNG files are added to `assets/images/logo/`, the fallback text displays will be replaced with the real logo graphics.
